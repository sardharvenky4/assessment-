    
            PROJECT 1
   1.What is the difference between SDLC (software development life cycle) and STLC (software testing life cycle)
   SDLC:
        These SDLC is completely deals with the testing of the project.There are six types of phases they are as follows
              *Requirement gathering
              *Analysis
              *Design
              *Coding
              *Testing
              *Deployment
  STLC:
       These STLC is completely deals with the  developing of the software's.There are six phasee are located they are as follows
              *Requirement analysis
              *Test planing
              *Test design
              *Environment setup
              *Test execution
              *Test closure
   #Differences between SDLC and STLC :
      
         SDLC:    
 * It's an development life cycle it completely deals with software development
 * There are six phases in SDLC
 * Requirement gathering will be gathered by the business analysts and developed by the software developers
 * It includes developing phases.
 * In SDLC developers were create high and low designs.
 * SDLC phases are completel before the STLC 
 * It's main goal is developing the softwares successfully
        STLC:
 * It's an Testing life cycle it completely deals with the software development
 *There are six phases in STLC
 *Testing team will be check the software from software and non software point of view
 * It only focus on the software testing
 * In STLC testing analyst were create system and  optimistic test plan
 *STLC phases are created after SDLC phases are completel
 * It's main goals are testing the software successfully
 
 2.what are the verification and validation
  Verification:
          *It can be checks the product at every stage 
          *Done by the developer
          *Concerned with phases contaminated errors
          *Methods involve reviews and inspection unit testing and integration
          *Static and integration testing
  Validation : 
          *It can only checks the final product 
          *Done by the tester 
          *Aim is to make final product error free
          *Involve system testing
          *Only dynamic

 3.what is Authentication and Authorization 
 Authentication : 
          *The process or action of verification or showing something to be true genuine or valid
          *The prints will be stamped with his seal and accompanied by a letter of authentication
 Authorization :
          *Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something
          *A good example is house ownership

 4.whar is test management review and why it is important?
          *Test management is a process of managing the testing activity in order to ensure High quality and high end testing of the software application
          *Organizing and controlling the testing process
          *Ensuring visibility , traceability and control of testing process to deliver high quality software
     Software testing process:
          *Test plan
          *Test design
          *Test execution
          *Exit criteria
          *Test reporting

 5.define client side and server side validation
       Client side: validation done in the browser is called client side validation
       Server side: while validation done on the server is called server side validation

 6.explain the request response flow from front end to back end
      * The backend and frontend both work together to server a single goal.
      * It's pretty helpful to keep it in mind at all times. They are made so a user can access them .
  
 7.explain life cycle phases of the project 
    There are 5 phases :
     *Initiating
     *Planning
     *Executing
     *Monitoring
     * Closing

 8.how do you define success
      *According to my self success means completing the given work successful without any errors 
      *Where as project success can be defined as the achievement of something desired planned or attempted

 9.what are your strengths and weakness 
        Strengths: good management skills , good communication skills ,good leadership skills
         Weakness: not easily mingle with others
         
 10.have you faced any challenging situations and how did you overcome it
       Actually a face one challenge in any intermediate marks results .
       Previously I got 7 GPA in Telugu later i applied for improvement then after completing the exam  I got 10 GPA point in that subject.
